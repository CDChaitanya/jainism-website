          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Definition:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Conduct refers to living according to the ethical and moral
            teachings of Jainism, which include the practice of non-violence,
            truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment. It is
            about living in harmony with oneself and others, minimizing harm to
            all living beings, and following the spiritual guidelines laid out
            in the scriptures.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Story Example:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Building on the previous steps of acquiring knowledge and having faith, the next essential step is action. In Jainism, Right Conduct ensures that our actions align with ethical principles like non-violence and honesty. For instance, while building your business, you must ensure that your actions whether it’s in your dealings with customers, partners, or employees reflect fairness, integrity, and respect for all beings. By acting ethically and staying true to your values, you can achieve your goals without compromising your principles.          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Importance:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Conduct is the most practical aspect of spiritual growth in Jainism. It’s not enough to just know what’s right or to believe in it; you must live by these principles every day. By practicing Right Conduct, we purify our souls, reduce negative karma, and move closer to liberation. It bridges the gap between knowledge and faith, ensuring that both are actively reflected in our actions. This leads to inner peace and spiritual progress, making Right Conduct a vital part of the Jain path.
