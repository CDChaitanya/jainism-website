          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Definition:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Conduct refers to living according to the ethical and moral
            teachings of Jainism, which include the practice of non-violence,
            truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment. It is
            about living in harmony with oneself and others, minimizing harm to
            all living beings, and following the spiritual guidelines laid out
            in the scriptures.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Story Example:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            The final step is action—to execute your plans based on the right
            knowledge and faith. Even with the best business knowledge and
            confidence in your idea, you must take action. This is where Right
            Conduct comes in; in Jainism, it means living in a way that aligns
            with ethical principles, like non-violence and honesty, while
            avoiding attachment to material success or results. In the context
            of becoming a billionaire, your actions must align with your goals,
            values, and the knowledge you've acquired.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Importance:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Conduct is the most practical aspect of spiritual growth. It
            is not enough to simply know what is right or to believe in it—you
            must embody these principles in your everyday actions. Right Conduct
            purifies the soul, reduces karma, and leads to liberation. It is a
            key part of the Jain path, ensuring that the right knowledge and
            right faith are put into practice in a way that brings about inner
            peace and spiritual progress.
