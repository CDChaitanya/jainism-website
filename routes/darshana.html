          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Definition:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Faith refers to having a correct understanding and belief in
            the Jain teachings, the path of non-violence (Ahimsa), and the
            possibility of liberation. It is the trust in the Jain scriptures,
            the guidance of the Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers), and the
            belief in the potential of the soul to achieve Moksha.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Story Example:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Continuing the example given by the guest lecture, in order to become a billionaire, after acquiring the 
            right knowledge about how businesses work, the next step is to have the right faith in your idea. 
            For instance, once you’ve learned about the market dynamics and identified a promising business opportunity, 
            you need to believe in its potential and trust your vision. This faith in your idea fuels your 
            perseverance and guides you through tough times, ensuring you stay committed to your goals, even when challenges arise.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Importance:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Faith is crucial because it provides the foundation for one's spiritual journey. 
            Without faith in the teachings and practices of Jainism, even the right knowledge can lead to 
            doubt and confusion. Faith gives the individual the strength and conviction needed to 
            follow the challenging path of self-discipline and spiritual growth. It is through faith that 
            one remains committed to the journey, trusting that each step brings them closer to spiritual liberation (moksha).
