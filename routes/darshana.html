          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Definition:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Faith refers to having a correct understanding and belief in
            the Jain teachings, the path of non-violence (Ahimsa), and the
            possibility of liberation. It is the trust in the Jain scriptures,
            the guidance of the Tirthankaras (spiritual teachers), and the
            belief in the potential of the soul to achieve Moksha.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Story Example:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            After acquiring the right knowledge, the next step is to have faith
            in your idea or business. For example, if you have identified a
            potential business opportunity, you need to believe in its success
            and trust in your vision. In the same way, in Jainism, right faith
            is about having trust in the spiritual path, believing that the
            practices outlined in Jainism will lead to liberation.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Importance:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Faith is essential because it forms the foundation for a
            person’s spiritual journey. Without faith in the teachings and
            practices of Jainism, even the right knowledge can lead to doubt or
            confusion. Faith sustains the individual, providing the conviction
            to follow the difficult path of self-discipline and inner
            purification.
