            Asteya, meaning "non-stealing," is another of the fundamental virtues in
            Jain philosophy, emphasizing the importance of honesty and respect
            for what belongs to others. Derived from the Sanskrit words <em>a</em>
            (non) and <em>steya</em> (stealing), it prohibits not just taking what
            isn’t freely given but also wanting or desiring another's
            possessions.

            <p class="section-text">The Acharanga Sutra emphasizes:</p>
            <p class="text-xl">परिग्रहेणैव कर्माणि बध्यन्ते</p>
            <p class="italic">
              Translation: "Attachments bind the soul to karma."

          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            This teaching underscores how even the desire for something not ours
            creates karmic bonds, hindering spiritual growth. Jain texts further
            elaborate that Asteya applies not only to material possessions but
            also to time, energy, and intellectual property, urging individuals
            to cultivate fairness and gratitude in all aspects of life.

          <p class="fade-in">
            Learning about Asteya challenged me to reflect on my actions and
            mindset in ways I hadn’t considered before. While I’ve always
            associated stealing with tangible items, Jainism’s expansive
            definition of theft made me realize how everyday habits can
            inadvertently violate this principle.

            What I Learned That I Wasn’t Aware Of
          </h2>

          <p class="highlight fade-in">
            <strong>Stealing time:</strong> One idea that stood out to me was
            how wasting someone’s time—whether by being late, unprepared, or
            inattentive—can also be considered a form of theft. This insight
            encouraged me to be more mindful of others' time and efforts.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight fade-in">
            <strong>Mental Stealing:</strong> The concept of stealing
            extends to thoughts and ideas as well. Plagiarism or even taking
            credit for someone else’s work in group settings violates the spirit
            of Asteya. Reflecting on this, I realized how crucial it is to give
            proper acknowledgment in every aspect of life.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight fade-in">
            <strong>Contentment and Gratitude:</strong> The texts also taught me
            that the root of theft often lies in discontentment. By practicing
            gratitude for what we have, we naturally let go of the desire for
            more, aligning our lives with the principle of Asteya.

            A New Perspective 
          </h2>
          <p class="fade-in">
            One example that deeply affected me was a passage from a Jain text. 
            It tells the story of a merchant known for his great wealth, but he was also famous for being dishonest in his trade. 
            Despite his material riches, he lived a life full of fear—constantly worried about his reputation and 
            obsessively guarding his possessions. In sharp contrast, a humble monk with no material wealth lived 
            a peaceful life, content with whatever alms he received.
          </p>
          <p>
            The text explained that the merchant’s fear itself was a form of
            Asteya. The merchant wasn’t just holding onto his material wealth
            but was also clinging to the fear of losing it. This fear "stole"
            his inner peace, making him constantly restless.
          </p>
          <p>
            This story opened my eyes to how Asteya is not limited to the
            physical act of theft. It extends to the mental and emotional realm,
            where we may cling to things—whether material possessions, fears, or
            anxieties that don't truly belong to us. The monk, on the other
            hand, with his detachment and peace, demonstrated that true freedom
            comes from letting go of the need to possess, and in doing so, one
            can find inner peace.

        <section class="admiration mt-8">
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">What I Admired</h2>
          <div class="highlight fade-in">
            <p>
              What I admired most about Asteya is its focus on fairness and
              gratitude. It goes beyond just refraining from taking things and
              emphasizes living in harmony with others by respecting their
              space, time, and effort. It encourages us to cultivate a sense of
              inner contentment, which reduces greed and promotes generosity.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also found it inspiring how the practice of Asteya fosters trust
              and community. When we live honestly and give credit where it’s
              due, we strengthen our relationships and contribute to a more
              ethical world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Studying Asteya has motivated me to be more mindful of how I
              interact with others. Whether it’s respecting someone’s ideas,
              valuing their time, or simply being grateful for what I have, I
              now see these small actions as meaningful steps toward living a
              life rooted in non-stealing.
