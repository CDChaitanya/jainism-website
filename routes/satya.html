            Satya, or truthfulness, is one of the foundational principles of
            Jainism. It emphasizes speaking and living in accordance with the
            truth, ensuring that one’s words and actions are rooted in honesty
            and integrity. Derived from the Sanskrit root <em>sat</em>, meaning "that
            which exists" or "truth," Satya in Jain philosophy goes beyond mere
            avoidance of falsehood. It also involves careful speech that does not
            harm others, reflecting Jainism's commitment to non-violence
            (Ahimsa).

            <p class="section-text">
              The concept of Satya is highlighted in the Acharanga Sutra:
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl">
              सत्यं ब्रूयात्, प्रियं ब्रूयात्, न ब्रूयात् सत्यमप्रियं।
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
              Translation: "Speak the truth, speak it lovingly, and never speak
              a truth that causes harm."
            </p>
          </div>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            In Jain thought, Satya is considered a path to spiritual liberation,
            as it aligns the soul with its purest state. However, this
            truthfulness must always be balanced with non-violence, ensuring
            that it does not lead to unnecessary pain or harm.
          </p>

          <div class="sanskrit fade-in">
            <p class="section-text">
              The Tattvartha Sutra further elaborates on Satya:
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl">"मिथ्यात्वं हिंसायाः कारणम्</p>
            <p class="italic">
              Translation: "Falsehood is a cause of violence."
            </p>

          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            This reinforces the idea that lying, even with seemingly harmless
            intentions, can disrupt harmony and lead to conflict or harm.

          <p class="fade-in">
            Studying Satya through Jain philosophy has been an enlightening
            experience. Before engaging with these teachings, I often thought of
            truth as a straightforward concept—speaking what is factually
            correct. However, the Jain perspective has shown me that truth is
            multi-faceted and deeply intertwined with non-violence and
            mindfulness.

            What I Learned That I Wasn’t Aware Of
          </h2>

          <p class="highlight fade-in">
            <strong>Truth with responsibility:</strong> The idea that
            truthfulness must be tempered with kindness and non-violence was a
            revelation to me. It made me realize that simply speaking the truth
            is not enough; how and when we communicate it matters just as much.
            For instance, harshly pointing out someone's mistakes might be
            truthful, but it could also be hurtful and counterproductive.
          </p>
          <p class="highlight fade-in">
            <strong>Living truthfully:</strong> Jainism extends the idea of
            Satya to all aspects of life, including actions and thoughts. This
            holistic approach to truthfulness—being true not only in words but
            also in intentions and deeds—challenged me to reflect on the
            alignment between my inner values and outward behavior.

            A New Perspective
          </h2>
          <p class="fade-in">
            In a guest lecture, Nishi Shah shared a thought-provoking example that reshaped my understanding of Satya, 
            or truth. He described a situation where a monk, while in a forest, had just seen a deer pass by. 
            Shortly after, a hunter approached him and asked if he had seen the deer. 
            Instead of giving a direct answer, the monk chose to remain silent. 
            Dr. Shah explained that the monk’s silence was a deliberate choice to uphold Satya in 
            the most compassionate way. By staying silent, the monk avoids lying and 
            prevents potential harm to the deer by not revealing its location.

        <section class="admiration mt-8">
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">What I Admired</h2>
          <div class="highlight fade-in">
            <p>
              What stood out to me about Satya is that it’s not just about
              telling the truth but also about speaking with kindness and care.
              Jainism teaches that truth should never harm others, and this idea
              gave me a new perspective on how I communicate. It’s not enough to
              just be honest; the way we say things matters too
            </p>
            <p>
              I admired how Satya encourages people to live with integrity—not
              just in their words but in their actions. It’s about being genuine
              and making sure that our thoughts, words, and deeds align. This
              approach doesn’t just help us stay true to ourselves but also
              builds trust and stronger relationships with others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Learning about Satya has inspired me to be more thoughtful in my
              daily life. Whether I’m giving feedback, resolving a disagreement,
              or just talking with friends, I now try to make sure that my
              honesty is paired with compassion. This balance between truth and
              care has made my interactions more meaningful and positive.
