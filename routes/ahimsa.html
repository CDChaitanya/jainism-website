                <p class="mb-4 fade-in">Ahimsa, or non-violence, is the cornerstone of Jain philosophy. The term Ahimsa is derived from the Sanskrit root <em>himsa</em> (to harm), with the prefix <em>a</em> (negation), signifying the complete absence of violence in thought, word, and deed.</p>
                
                <div class="sanskrit fade-in">
                    <p class="text-xl">अहिंसा परमॊ धर्मः</p>
                    <p class="italic">Translation: "Non-violence is the highest dharma"</p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">This teaching emphasizes that non-violence is not just a virtue but the supreme ethical principle that governs all actions in Jain philosophy. It serves as a guiding tenet, shaping every aspect of a Jain's life, including their behavior and interactions with all living beings.                </p>
                
                <div class="sanskrit fade-in">
                    <p class="text-xl">सर्वे पाणे न हन्ता, न जियथा</p>
                    <p class="italic">Translation: "No living being should be hurt or killed"</p>
                </div>
                <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">This teaching underscores a core Jain belief: that all life forms, from the smallest insects to the largest animals, are interconnected and sacred. Jainism teaches that violence is not only a physical act but also a matter of intention, thought, and care.                </p>

                <p class="fade-in">
                    Studying Ahimsa through Jain texts has been an eye-opening experience. Initially, I understood non-violence primarily as refraining from physical harm, but as I delved deeper into the teachings, I realized that Ahimsa encompasses far more than just the absence of physical violence.

                <p class="highlight fade-in">
                    <strong>Intent Matters:</strong> I hadn’t fully grasped that violence is not limited to physical acts. Mental and verbal violence also fall under the concept of himsa. Even harboring ill will or speaking harshly can be considered forms of violence. This realization profoundly expanded my understanding of non-violence.
                </p>
                <p class="highlight fade-in">
                    <strong>Ahimsa and the Environment:</strong> The idea that harm to natural elements—such as water, air, or soil—is also a form of violence was a new insight for me. This concept made me more aware of how everyday actions, such as wasting water or littering, indirectly contribute to harm in the world.

                <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">A New Perspective</h2>
                <p class="fade-in">The guest lecture by Nishi Shah brought a transformative perspective on himsa (violence). The speaker explained that himsa often starts with ourselves. We tend to be overly critical of our own actions, creating a pattern of internal violence. I had never truly recognized how self-criticism could be a form of violence, but reflecting on it, I realized that my own self-doubt and harsh judgments were limiting my personal growth.
                    <br/>
                    Moreover, the speaker emphasized that after being critical of ourselves, we often extend this himsa towards those closest to us. This struck a chord with me, as I recognized how my frustration with myself would sometimes spill over into my relationships, affecting how I interacted with my loved ones.

                <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">What I Admired</h2>
                <div class="highlight fade-in">
                    <p>One of the aspects I most admired about Jainism’s approach to Ahimsa is its universality. Unlike other philosophies that prioritize human life, Jainism’s principle of Ahimsa extends to all living beings, no matter how small. This idea made me think more about how my actions affect everyone, and how to be fair to all.
                        <br/>
                        The practice of Ahimsa as an active choice rather than passive avoidance also stood out to me. Jainism does not teach us to merely avoid harm; it urges us to actively cultivate kindness, mindfulness, and awareness in our thoughts and actions. For example, choosing to speak kindly even when upset or making efforts to reduce my ecological footprint are proactive ways of living the principle of Ahimsa.
