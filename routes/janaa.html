          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Definition:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Right Knowledge refers to a proper understanding of the true nature
            of reality, the universe, the soul, and the law of karma. It
            involves recognizing the distinctions between what is eternal (the
            soul) and what is temporary (material world), understanding the
            workings of karma, and realizing that spiritual development leads to
            liberation.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Story Example:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            Nishi Shah, the guest lecturer, explained this point by giving a
            practical example. Suppose you want to become a billionaire. The
            first step is to acquire the right knowledge—knowing how businesses
            work, understanding the market dynamics, recognizing opportunities,
            and understanding how investments grow. Without this knowledge, you
            may make decisions based on ignorance, which could lead to failure.
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-title text-2xl mb-4">Importance:</h2>
          <p class="mb-4 highlight fade-in">
            In Jainism, right knowledge is essential for spiritual progress. It
            clears away misconceptions and ignorance, allowing one to see the
            world and the soul as they truly are. Without right knowledge, a
            person cannot develop the right faith or practice the right conduct
            because they lack the understanding of what they are striving for.
